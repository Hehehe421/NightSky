### Important Reminders
The `requirements.txt` file contains all the Python libraries required by the notebooks in this repository. Ensure the appropriate version of each package is installed. For instance, `tzwhere` is incompatible with the latest version of Numpy. Consider installing an older version of Numpy or switch from `tzwhere` to `timezonefinder` to address this compatibility issue.

Special thanks to @vschaik for pointing out package compliance concerns.
